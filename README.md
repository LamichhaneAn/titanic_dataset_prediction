# titanic_dataset_prediction
The Titanic dataset represents a standard machine learning problem.

One of the classic machine learning problems is the Titanic dataset. It offers details about the people who traveled on the Titanic, with the aim of estimating the probability of a passenger's survival based on a range of characteristics, including age, gender, class, and more. This project serves as a introduction to feature engineering, model building, and data cleansing.

Summary of each field in the Titanic dataset:

passengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger:

Survived: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0) Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).

Name: Name of the passneger. Sex: Gender of the passenger(male or female). Age: age of the passenger (fractional if less than 1). Sibsp: Number of siblings/spouse abroad the Titanic. 

Parch: Number of parents/children abroad the Titanic. Ticket: Ticket number.

I'll go over the complete process of handling the Titanic dataset using Python, including the following:

1.Load the Data
2.Explore the Data
3.Clean the Data
4.Feature Engineering
Select and Train a Model
5.Evaluate the Model
6.Predict and Submit Results
